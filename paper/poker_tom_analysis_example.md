# Theory of Mind Analysis: Specific Poker Example

## **Scenario Setup**
**Hero Hand:** A♠ Q♥  
**Board:** K♥ T♥ 4♦ 9♣ 2♠  
**Pot:** $150, Opponent bets $110  
**Hero has:** Ace-high with backdoor straight draw (needs J for Broadway)

---

## **Level 0: Surface Analysis Only (No Mental State Attribution)**

**Analysis:**
*"The opponent's bet size is $110 into a $150 pot (73% pot-size bet). The board shows two hearts creating flush possibilities. Given the bet sizing and board texture, this represents either a strong value hand (flush, two-pair, set) or a bluff with missed draws. The mathematical pot odds are 2.36:1, requiring 29.7% equity to call profitably."*

**Characteristics:**
• Pure mathematical calculation - pot odds, bet sizing ratios
• Pattern recognition - "flush possibilities", "board texture"  
• NO mental state attribution - never considers what opponent thinks
• Mechanical analysis only

## **Level 1: First-Order Theory of Mind ("Opponent Thinks X")**

### Story A (Bluff Scenario):
*"Given this opponent's history of firing with missed draws (like the previous 8♦-6♦ bluff), they likely have a busted heart draw or missed straight draw. **They believe their bluff can fold out our range** since the board looks scary with the flush possibility."*

### Story B (Value Scenario):  
*"This tight opponent only bets big when **they believe they have a strong hand**. The bet size suggests they likely completed the heart flush or have two-pair/set. **They think their hand is strong enough** to bet for value."*

**Characteristics:**
• Considers opponent's **beliefs about their own hand**
• "They believe", "they think" language emerges
• First-order mental state attribution

## **Level 2: Second-Order Theory of Mind ("Opponent Thinks I Think Y")**

### Story A (Bluff Scenario):
*"This opponent **knows I've seen them bluff before** with missed draws. They're **exploiting the fact that I know** they can bluff by choosing this scary board to bluff again. **They think I think** they have the flush because of the two hearts, so **they believe I'll fold** hands like mine that can't beat a flush. **They're using my knowledge of their bluffing history against me** - expecting me to call light because I've seen them bluff."*

### Story B (Value Scenario):
*"This tight opponent **knows I perceive them as conservative**. **They think I think** they only bet big with strong hands. **They're counting on my image of them** to get value from my calling range. **They believe I believe** they have a flush, so they expect me to call with hands that beat bluffs but lose to flushes (like pairs, two-pairs)."*

**Characteristics:**
• **Recursive mental modeling** - "they think I think"
• **Image exploitation** - using opponent's perception strategically  
• **Meta-psychological warfare** - weaponizing mental models
• **Sophisticated deception understanding** - layered reasoning about perception

## **The Cognitive Hierarchy**

**Level 0:** "Math says this bet size typically means X or Y"
**Level 1:** "Opponent believes they have X, so they're betting"  
**Level 2:** "Opponent wants me to believe they have X based on what they think I think about them"

**Key Insight:** Level 2 reasoning transforms poker from game-theory into psychology - the physical cards become secondary to the mental chess match of perception and counter-perception.
