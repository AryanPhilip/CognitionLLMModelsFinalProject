# Theory of Mind Levels: Real Model Responses

## **Level 0: Surface Analysis Only (No Mental State Attribution)**

**Actual Hush-Qwen Response:**
*"Given the opponent's history of betting on paired rivers and the board texture suggesting a scarcity of real full house hands, it's likely that this bet does not represent a value hand. The bet size of $100+ is relatively large, which aligns with his aggressive paired river betting pattern..."*

**Notice:** 
• Pure pattern analysis - "betting pattern", "board texture"
• NO mental state words - never says what opponent "thinks" or "believes"
• Mathematical reasoning only - bet sizes, hand probabilities

## **Level 1: First-Order Theory of Mind ("Opponent Thinks X")**

**Actual Hush-Qwen Response:**
*"The opponent has a history of committing big bets with strong hands like King-high flushes, and the board texture supports this. The 8/7 pot bet size is consistent with his value-betting pattern for strong hands given the presence of multiple hearts."*

**Notice:**
• Still mostly pattern-based BUT...
• Implicit mental state reasoning - assumes opponent acts on what they have
• Beginning to consider opponent's perspective on their own hand

## **Level 2: Second-Order Theory of Mind ("Opponent Thinks I Think Y")**

**Actual Hush-Qwen Response:**
*"Given the opponent's history of triple-barreling missed draws and showing down a back-door flush, it's likely they are attempting to exploit your hand range with a bluff. The board texture, while giving some flush potential, doesn't strongly suggest a value bet..."*

**Notice:**
• **Strategic deception reasoning** - "attempting to exploit your hand range"
• **Second-order modeling** - opponent considering what YOU think about THEIR range
• **Sophisticated bluff detection** - understanding deceptive intent

## **The Cognitive Progression**
**Level 0**: "Pattern says X"  
**Level 1**: "Opponent has X, so they bet"  
**Level 2**: "Opponent wants me to think they have X"

**Key Finding: Only 5.6% of responses achieve Level 2 sophistication**
