Hush-Qwen2.5-7B & Level 2 & \textit{"Given the opponent's history of triple-barreling missed draws, it's likely they are attempting to exploit your hand range with a bluff... doesn't strongly suggest a value bet from a holding like A-Q offsuit, which would typically be more inclined to check or call rather than bet into you."} \\

& Level 1 & \textit{"The opponent enjoys bluffing on such boards where few hands can make a strong draw, making the 2â™  the perfect scare card to extract value from players who might be semi-bluffing."} \\

OLMoE-1B-7B & Level 0-1 & \textit{"The board texture suggests a potential flush draw, and the full pot bet size, it is more likely that this is a value bet rather than a bluff."} \\
