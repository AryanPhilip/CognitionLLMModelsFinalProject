# Final Presentation Slides Content

## Slide 11: Thoughts & Improvements

### Study Limitations
• **Context Scope**: Focused on poker scenarios - broader contexts needed
• **Model Selection**: Limited to 4 models - larger model survey required  
• **ToM Measurement**: Manual coding - automated assessment methods needed
• **Response Length**: Varied explanation lengths may bias ToM detection

### Methodological Improvements
• **Standardized Prompts**: More controlled prompt engineering
• **Blind Evaluation**: Multiple independent raters for ToM classification
• **Longitudinal Analysis**: Track ToM development across model iterations
• **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test ToM in non-gaming strategic contexts

### Technical Enhancements
• **Temperature Sensitivity**: Explore impact of generation parameters
• **Fine-tuning Effects**: Compare base vs instruction-tuned models
• **Chain-of-Thought**: Structured reasoning protocols for ToM elicitation
• **Adversarial Testing**: Deliberate ToM failure scenarios

## Slide 12: Future Work

### Theoretical Extensions
• **Multi-Order ToM**: Investigate Level 3+ reasoning capabilities
• **False Belief Tasks**: Classic developmental psychology paradigms
• **Social Cognition**: Emotion attribution and empathy modeling
• **Cultural Context**: Cross-cultural ToM reasoning patterns

### Technical Directions
• **Real-Time ToM**: Dynamic opponent modeling in interactive settings
• **ToM Benchmarks**: Standardized evaluation datasets and metrics
• **Neurosymbolic Approaches**: Combine neural and symbolic ToM reasoning
• **Explainable AI**: ToM-aware model interpretability frameworks

### Application Domains
• **Human-AI Collaboration**: ToM for better team coordination
• **Educational AI**: Adaptive tutoring with student mental modeling
• **Therapeutic Applications**: AI assistants with empathetic reasoning
• **Game AI**: More sophisticated non-player character behavior

### Research Questions
• **Scaling Laws**: How does model size affect ToM sophistication?
• **Training Data**: What linguistic patterns develop ToM capabilities?
• **Transfer Learning**: Does ToM generalize across domains?
• **Emergence**: At what point do models develop genuine ToM?

## Slide 13: Conclusion

### Key Findings

• **LLMs Demonstrate Measurable Theory of Mind Capabilities**
  - 64.7% show first-order reasoning, 5.6% achieve second-order ToM

• **Deception Detection is the Ultimate Cognitive Challenge**
  - 22.7% performance gap between bluff vs value detection

• **Model Sophistication Varies Dramatically Across Architectures**
  - Hush-Qwen: 93.3% accuracy vs Llama-1B: 12.2% accuracy

• **Context Integration Drives Cognitive Performance**
  - Rich scenarios enable sophisticated mental state reasoning (r=0.420)

### Final Takeaway
**"This research provides first quantitative evidence that modern LLMs possess Theory of Mind capabilities, with deception detection serving as the ultimate test of AI cognitive sophistication."**
