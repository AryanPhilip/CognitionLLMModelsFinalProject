# Theory of Mind Levels: Real Examples

## **Level 0: No Theory of Mind (Surface Analysis Only)**

**Example Response:**
*"Given the board texture with Q-J-2 and potential draws, the 50% pot bet sizing suggests a value bet. The opponent likely has a made hand like two pair or better and is betting for value rather than bluffing."*

**Characteristics:**
• **No opponent psychology** - focuses only on cards and math
• **No mental state attribution** - never mentions what opponent thinks
• **Technical analysis only** - board texture, bet sizing, hand ranges

## **Level 1: First-Order Theory of Mind ("Opponent Thinks X")**

**Example Response:**
*"The opponent thinks they have a strong hand here. Given their tight playing style, they likely believe their hand is ahead. The bet suggests they want to extract value from what they perceive as a strong holding."*

**Characteristics:**
• **Mental state attribution** - "opponent thinks", "they believe", "they perceive"
• **Simple psychology** - attributes beliefs and intentions to opponent
• **Still sincere focus** - assumes opponent acts on what they think they have

## **Level 2: Second-Order Theory of Mind ("Opponent Thinks I Think Y")**

**Example Response:**
*"The opponent is trying to exploit your range here. They know you perceive them as aggressive after their recent bluffs, so they're betting to induce folds from your medium-strength hands. This is a sophisticated bluff designed to make you think they have you beat."*

**Characteristics:**
• **Strategic deception reasoning** - "exploit your range", "induce folds"
• **Second-order modeling** - "they know you perceive them as..."
• **Sophisticated psychology** - understanding of deceptive intent and manipulation

## **Key Progression: From Cards to Mind Reading**

**Level 0** → **Level 1** → **Level 2**
*Cards & Math* → *"Opponent Thinks"* → *"Opponent Thinks I Think"*

**The Cognitive Leap:** Only 5.6% of explanations reach Level 2 sophistication
